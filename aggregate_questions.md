# **Aggregate Function Challenges**

## **Aggregate Functions Overview**

Aggregate functions perform calculations on multiple rows and return a single result. Common aggregate functions:

- `COUNT()`: Counts the number of rows.
- `SUM()`: Adds values.
- `AVG()`: Calculates the average.
- `MIN()`: Returns the smallest value.
- `MAX()`: Returns the largest value.
